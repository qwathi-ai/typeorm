     * ### url: string | Array<string> (Default: http://localhost:8529)
     * Base URL of the ArangoDB server or list of server URLs.
     * 
     * When working with a cluster or a single server with leader/follower failover, the method db.acquireHostList can be used to automatically pick up additional Coordinators/followers at any point.
     * 
     * When running ArangoDB on a unix socket, e.g. /tmp/arangodb.sock, the following URL formats are supported for unix sockets:
     * * unix:///tmp/arangodb.sock (no SSL)
     * * http+unix:///tmp/arangodb.sock (or https+unix:// for SSL)
     * * http://unix:/tmp/arangodb.sock (or https://unix: for SSL)
     * 
     * Additionally ssl and tls are treated as synonymous with https and tcp is treated as synonymous with http, so the following URLs are considered identical:
     * * tcp://localhost:8529 and http://localhost:8529
     * * ssl://localhost:8529 and https://localhost:8529
     * * tcp+unix:///tmp/arangodb.sock and http+unix:///tmp/arangodb.sock
     * * ssl+unix:///tmp/arangodb.sock and https+unix:///tmp/arangodb.sock
     * * tcp://unix:/tmp/arangodb.sock and http://unix:/tmp/arangodb.sock
     * * ssl://unix:/tmp/arangodb.sock and https://unix:/tmp/arangodb.sock
     * If you want to use ArangoDB with authentication, see useBasicAuth or useBearerAuth methods.
     * If you need to support self-signed HTTPS certificates, you may have to add your certificates to the agentOptions, e.g.:
     * ```js
     * agentOptions: {
     *  ca: [
     *      fs.readFileSync(".ssl/sub.class1.server.ca.pem"),
     *      fs.readFileSync(".ssl/ca.pem")
     *  ]
     * }
     * ```
     * Although this is strongly discouraged, itâ€™s also possible to disable HTTPS certificate validation entirely, but note this has extremely dangerous security implications:
     * ```js
     * agentOptions: {
     *  rejectUnauthorized: false
     * }
     * ```
     */

    /**
     * ### isAbsolute: boolean (Default: false)

     * Note: This makes it impossible to switch databases with useDatabase or using acquireHostList. This is only intended to be used as an escape hatch when working with standalone servers exposing a single database API from behind a reverse proxy, which is not a recommended setup.
